2. Application of 5 NRM Pillars
3. Product Performance Evaluation
4. Growth Opportunity Identification
5. New Product Launch Analysis
6. Forecasting with NRM Initiatives

## Key Findings

- HealthMax active in 2 out of 5 shampoo subcategories
- Organic shampoos: Fastest-growing subcategory (20% projected growth for 2024)
- Starburst Ultra Soft 100ml: Top performer (71% gross margin contribution, 18% net sales contribution)
- "Buy 2 Get 20% Off" identified as most successful promotion
- New 50ml pack size opportunity for traveling customers

## Tools & Techniques Used
